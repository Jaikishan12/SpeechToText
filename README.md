# SpeechToText
Designed an Speech Recognition System trained on Medical Data which is can be integrated for better user-patient diagnostics. 

Initially, it involved understanding the state of art in the field of speech to text and using them as a reference for models we build. During this phase we planned the implementation and researched about the working of Speech to Text and procured the online available dataset. Next, we started implementing mainly 2 models, the CNN and the Wav2Vec2 models and analysing their performance metrics. Further efforts in obtaining better dataset was necessary in order to obtain audio files with Indian Accent and medical terms for better performance of the models. Accuracies as high as 80% was achieved in the first phase of implementation which was bettered to 90% in the latter phases with validation, fine-tuning and better dataset.
